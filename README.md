Coding Assessment->
1 - By using "Starlette Framework" create an API endpoint which will return all the posts of 
user_id = 1
2 - Create an Authentication middleware
Instructions->
- You should follow MVC architecture.
- You should follow test driven approach.
- For this challenge you can use an array of POST records(No need to configure DB).
Post data fields-
 - post_id
 - category_id
 - post_name
 - post_title
 - post_description
 - user_id
- For every sub task you have to push the changes in your git with a valid commit message.
 Ex - once you are done with framework setup, push the changes with a commit message 
'framework setup'
 similarly for API, Middleware & Test cases
